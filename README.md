- Hi, I’m @ j.m.croft @ hotmail
- I am interested in cloud computing and AI
- I am AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- I have a Master's Degree in Philosophy. I always have been interested in technology, its ontological foundations, and its potential for the betterment of the human race. I have a working knowledge of Python, JavaScript, bash, etc. In cloud computing, I see the next frontier for technology that will continue to expand for years to come; it is becoming a necessary underpinning of the entire civilization.
